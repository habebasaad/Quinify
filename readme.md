# **Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization**

## Project Overview
The project presents an implementation of the Quine-McCluskey logic minimization algorithm in C/C++ language. 

## key features of the C/C++ program
- Reads an input of text file stating the boolean function in terms of minterms and don't care terms.
- Generates the prime implicants (PI), and uses them to identify all the essential prime implicants.
- Derive a minimized form of the boolean expression of the function using the PI table.
- There are 10 test cases to showcase the features of the project's implementation.

## Verilog Module
